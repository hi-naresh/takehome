# Backend Overview - Developer Perspective

## Current Architecture & Design Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
**Current State**: Using a monorepo structure for rapid development and testing.

**Future Vision**: 
- Will transition to microservices architecture for better scalability
- Each service will have independent dependencies and deployment cycles
- Single commits will be replaced with isolated service deployments
- CI/CD pipeline will be designed for auto-deployment of individual services
- This isolation will be implemented once integrated into the team's infrastructure

### Technology Stack
**Current State**: TypeScript-only implementation across all services.

**Future Vision**:
- Will adopt a polyglot microservices approach
- AI/ML microservice will be implemented in Python for better ML ecosystem support
- This will provide more flexibility and leverage Python's extensive ML libraries
- Each service will use the most appropriate language for its domain

### Deployment Strategy
**Current State**: Simple deployment without containerization concerns.

**Future Vision**:
- Will implement Docker containerization for all services
- CI/CD pipelines will be established for automated deployment
- Architecture pattern will be decided after complete backend structure planning
- Considering event-driven architecture or other patterns based on system requirements

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting & File Upload Controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Will implement rate limiting on API endpoints, especially for extraction services
- **File Upload Limits**: Size limits will be enforced on file uploads to prevent abuse
- **Extraction Throttling**: AI extraction services will have rate limiting to manage costs and performance

### AI Provider Architecture
**Current Implementation**: OpenAI GPT integration with abstract provider pattern.

**Future Vision**:
- **AI Abstract Provider**: Centralized AI service abstraction that can be utilized across the entire system
- **Multiple Implementations**: Various AI service implementations will be supported
- **Model Flexibility**: Currently using OpenAI GPT, but can easily integrate other models (Claude, Gemini, etc.) when needed
- **Provider Switching**: Easy switching between different AI providers without code changes

## Development Philosophy

### Scalability First
- Every decision is made with future scalability in mind
- Current simple implementations are placeholders for more robust solutions
- Architecture is designed to support growth and team expansion

### Team Integration Ready
- Code structure and patterns are designed for team collaboration
- Documentation and testing are comprehensive for easy onboarding
- Clear separation of concerns for different team members to work on different services

### Production Readiness
- While current implementation is simplified, the foundation is built for production requirements
- Security, monitoring, and error handling are considered from the ground up
- Easy migration path from current state to production-ready microservices

## Next Steps

1. **Team Integration**: Adapt current structure to team's preferred patterns and tools
2. **Microservices Migration**: Plan and execute transition to microservices architecture
3. **Language Specialization**: Implement Python-based AI/ML microservice
4. **Containerization**: Add Docker and CI/CD pipeline implementation
5. **Architecture Pattern**: Decide on event-driven or other architectural patterns
6. **Production Hardening**: Add comprehensive monitoring, logging, and security measures
